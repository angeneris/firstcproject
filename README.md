## Mad Libs Game
This is a simple console-based Mad Libs game written in C#. This was the very first program I ever coded aside from "Hello, world" so I keep it up here as a reminder. If you are a beginner coder, than this is a great simple project to quickly create and interact with your code. I used a template found online to get started with this project, so feel free to use this one to create your own!

### Description
In this game, the user is prompted to input various words and phrases to complete a pre-defined story template. The program then combines the user's inputs with the story template to create a unique and often humorous story.

### How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter words and phrases as requested.
3. Enjoy the generated Mad Libs story at the end.

### Instructions
When prompted, enter words or phrases as specified in the prompts.
Take note of the context provided in each prompt to ensure your input fits the story correctly.
After all inputs are provided, the completed Mad Libs story will be displayed.

#### Programming language use:
âœ§ C# but you can program this with almost any language 


Contributions are welcome! This is of course from a very popular template circulating online.
